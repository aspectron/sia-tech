No major vulnerabilities have been found in the Sia consensus protocol since the initial launch on June 7th.The client software is firmly in beta. Most serious bugs have been eliminated, but there are still rough or frustrating elements to the user experience. There may also be lingering bugs that would put coins or files at risk. Use with caution. There is no warranty on the software. Restarting the software is usually a good way to resolve unexpected issues.")

				"title": _T("What is a file contract?"),
				"text": _T(" A file contract enables a host and a renter to make an agreement about a file; the host agrees to store a file for some duration of time, and then gets paid some money for doing so. The renter pays all of the coins up front, and the blockchain acts as escrow. If the host keeps the file and submits a proof of storage at the end, the host will get the payment. Otherwise, (depending on the terms of the contract), the payment is returned to the uploader. All payments need to be made in Sia’s local currency, the siacoin.")

Like Bitcoin, Siacoin uses a blockchain, and is powered by \"proof-of-work\" mining. However, Siacoin and Bitcoin are not in direct competition. Bitcoin is a general-purpose currency, while Siacoin exists only to enable the Sia network.")
			},{
				"title": _T("Why does Sia need its own currency? Couldn't it use a payment processor like PayPal?"),
				"text": _T("This would make it much harder for clients to pay hosts directly. In addition, Sia creates a large volume of very small transactions (i.e. micropayments; think less than 1¢), which traditional payment processors are not designed to handle. Finally, using a blockchain also makes it possible to enforce contracts in a cryptographically secure way.")
			},{
				"title": _T("How can I get siacoins?"),

			},{
				"title": _T("What is the difference between Siacoin and Siafund?"),
				"text": _T("The two are different assets. The Siafund grants you access to a portion of the hosts income. If you buy a siafund for $200, it means that over the lifetime of the Siafund you expect to earn $200 back (plus interest). If Sia achieves its goal of cloud storage domination, each Siafund will earn probably somewhere between $10,000 and $250,000 for their owners each. The discount represents risk that Sia will never grow that large.The Siacoin is used to buy storage on the Sia network, and it's base value is derived from that.")

				"title": _T("What is wallet locking?"),

				"text": _T("Currently, you cannot choose your own password. People typically overestimate their ability to create strong passwords, and many people have lost coins due to theft as the result of having a weak password. For this reason, there is no support for user-generated passwords in the default Sia software.")

			},{
				"title": _T("I am not getting any contracts."),

Someone will only be able to decrypt and fetch the files if they have metadata about the files. This metadata is stored in something called a ‘.sia’ or a ‘siafile’. By sharing the siafile associated with a file that’s been uploaded to Sia, you give someone the ability to download that file. To share files privately, you can give the siafiles to people you trust. They will be able to download the file, and as long as they don’t share it, nobody else will. You can share files publicly by putting the associated siafiles in a public place.")
